Since JSHint is so flexible, you can easily adjust it in \nthe environment you expect your code to execute. JSHint is open source and\nwill always stay this way.\n\n## Our goal\n\nThe project aims to help JavaScript developers write complex programs\nwithout worrying about typos and language gotchas.\n\nAny code base eventually becomes huge at some point, so simple mistakes — that\nwould not show themselves when written — can become show stoppers and add \nextra hours of debugging. So, static code analysis tools come into play\nand help developers spot such problems. JSHint scans a program written in\nJavaScript and reports about commonly made mistakes and potential bugs. The\npotential problem could be a syntax error, a bug due to an implicit type\nconversion, a leaking variable, or something else entirely.\n\nOnly 15% of all programs linted on [jshint.com](http://jshint.com) pass the\nJSHint checks. In all other cases, JSHint finds some red flags that could've\nbeen bugs or potential problems.\n\nPlease note, that while static code analysis tools can spot many different kind\nof mistakes, it can't detect if your program is correct, fast or has memory\nleaks. You should always combine tools like JSHint with unit and functional\ntests as well as with code reviews.\n\n## Reporting a bug\n\nTo report a bug simply create a\n[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/new) and describe\nyour problem or suggestion. We welcome all kinds of feedback regarding\nJSHint including but not limited to:\n\n * When JSHint doesn't work as expected\n * When JSHint complains about valid JavaScript code that works in all browsers\n * When you simply want a new option or feature\n\nBefore reporting a bug, please look around to see if there are any open or closed tickets\nthat discuss your issue, and remember the wisdom: pull request > bug report > tweet.\n\n## Who uses JSHint?\n\nEngineers from these companies and projects use JSHint:\n\n* [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/)\n* [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/)\n* [Facebook](https://facebook.com/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)\n* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)\n* [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)\n* [Medium](https://medium.com/)\n* [Yahoo!](https://yahoo.com/)\n* [SmugMug](http://smugmug.com/)\n* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)\n* [PDF.js](http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js)\n* [Coursera](http://coursera.com/)\n* [Adobe Brackets](http://brackets.io/)\n* [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.io/)\n* [RedHat](http://redhat.com/)\n* [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/)\n* [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com/)\n* [Yelp](https://yelp.com/)\n* [Voxer](http://voxer.com/)\n* [EnyoJS](http://enyojs.com/)\n* [QuickenLoans](http://quickenloans.com/)\n* [oDesk](http://www.odesk.com/)\n* [Cloud9](http://c9.io/)\n* [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/)\n* [Pandoo TEK](http://pandootek.com/)\n* [Zendesk](http://zendesk.com/)\n* [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/)\n* [Google](https://www.google.com/)\n\nAnd many more!\n\n## License\n\nMost files are published using [the standard MIT Expat\nlicense](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#Expat).
