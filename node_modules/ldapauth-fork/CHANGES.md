```javascript
new LdapAuth({
  "url": "ldaps://ldap.example.com:636",
  "adminDn": "cn=LdapAdmin,dc=local",
  "adminPassword": "LdapAdminPassword",
  "searchBase": "dc=users,dc=local",
  "searchFilter": "(&(objectClass=person)(sAMAccountName={{username}}))",
  "searchAttributes": [
    "dn", "cn", "givenName", "name", "memberOf", "sAMAccountName"
  ],
  "groupSearchBase": "dc=groups,dc=local",
  "groupSearchFilter": "(member={{dn}})",
  "groupSearchAttributes": ["dn", "cn", "sAMAccountName"]
});
```

# node-ldapauth Changelog

## 2.2.3 (not yet released)

(nothing yet)


## 2.2.2

- [issue #5] update to bcrypt 0.7.5 (0.7.3 fixes potential mem issues)


## 2.2.1

- Fix a bug where ldapauth `authenticate()` would raise an example on an empty
  username.


## 2.2.0

- Update to latest ldapjs (0.5.6) and other deps.
  Note: This makes ldapauth only work with node >=0.8 (because of internal dep
  in ldapjs 0.5).


## 2.1.0

- Update to ldapjs 0.4 (from 0.3). Crossing fingers that this doesn't cause breakage.


## 2.0.0

- Add `make check` for checking jsstyle.
- [issue #1] Update to bcrypt 0.5. This means increasing the base node from 0.4
  to 0.6, hence the major version bump.


## 1.0.2

First working version.
